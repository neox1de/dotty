# Dotty - A Modern Dotfile Manager

Dotty is a modern dotfile manager written in Rust that helps you manage your configuration files and packages on Arch Linux systems. It supports installing dotfiles from GitHub repositories or local folders, with automatic package installation and backup management.

## Features

- üì¶ Install dotfiles from GitHub repositories or local folders
- üîÑ Automatic package installation (both official repos and AUR)
- üîí Automatic backup of existing configuration files
- ‚öôÔ∏è YAML-based configuration
- üöÄ Fast and reliable (written in Rust)
- üîß Easy to use CLI interface

## Installation

### Using Cargo

you can use cargo to install the tool:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/neox1de/dotty
```
### From Source
1. clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neox1de/dotty.git
```
2. build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
3. run the program:
```bash
./target/release/dotty
```

## Usage

Dotty provides a command-line interface to manage your dotfiles. Here are some common commands:

- **Clone and install dotfiles from a GitHub repository:**

  ```bash
  dotty -r username/repo
  ```

- **Install dotfiles from a local folder:**

  ```bash
  dotty -f /path/to/dotfiles
  ```
  
- **Clean backup files:**

  ```bash
  dotty -c
  ```

## Configuration

Dotty uses a `dotty.yaml` file to define the configuration for your dotfiles and packages. This file should be located in the root of your dotfiles repository or folder. Here's an example of what it might look like:

```yaml
packages:
  - name: neovim
    is_aur: false
    files:
      - source: config/nvim # source path is relative to the repository root
        destination: ~/.config/nvim
settings:
  skip_existing: false
```

For a more detailed example configuration, checkout the [dotty.yaml](example/dotty.yaml) file.
